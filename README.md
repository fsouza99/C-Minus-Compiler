# C-Minus Compiler

A compiler project for the C-Minus language implemented in Python.
For now, it contains a scanner and a parser.

## Directories

The *examples* directory contains code files written in C-Minus. The *(error)* variants are these same *cm* files, but with selected errors included for testing purposes.

The scanner produces the *trace* files. They contain the tokens extracted through complete *cm* file readings.

The parser produces the *tree* files, which hold the syntax tree of a program in a *cm* file.
